            <article class="currentsituation">
                Since the outbreak was declared September 20, Ebola has spread across Uganda and reached the capital Kampala,
                 though health authorities this week said case numbers were falling.
                The two central districts at the heart of the outbreak, Mubende and Kassanda, were placed under a 21 day lockdown by President Yoweri Museveni on October 15.
                The measures including a dusk to dawn curfew, a ban on personal travel, and the closure of markets, bars and churches were extended November 5 by another 21 days.
                The strain now circulating is known as the Sudan Ebola virus, for which there is no vaccine, although several potential jabs are heading toward clinical trials.

        <h2>key Facts</h2>
            <article class="keyfacts">
                <ul>
            <li>Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, 
            <br>is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans.
            The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals 
            <br>and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
            The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%.</li><br>
             <li>Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.
            Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.
            Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, 
            <br>namely case management, infection prevention and control practices,<br>
             surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service,
            safe and dignified burials and social mobilisation.</li><br>
            <li>Vaccines to protect against Ebola have been developed and have been used 
            <br>to help control the spread of Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and in the Democratic 
            Republic of the Congo (DRC).</li><br>
            <li>Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. <br>
            Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of  Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.
            Pregnant and breastfeeding women with Ebola should be offered early supportive care.<br> Likewise vaccine prevention and experimental treatment should be offered under the same conditions as for non-pregnant population.</li> </article>
